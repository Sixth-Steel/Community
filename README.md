Tutorials will appear as plain text files like this one. However, they can be marked up to to add section headings, boldface, and even images can be imported provided they reference an accompanying files that is uploaded. This files (eg, plain text and images) can all be organized into folders which you can navigate by clicking. Edits to text files are tracked, allowing you to see past contents if they are ever needed. Although written in plain text, you can create tables, add section headings, and emphasis to plain text using [GitHub's MarkDown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

MarkDown is a simple way to annotate text files so they are easily read without any special fonts or rendering, but also so they look good when rendered using the formatting rules. For example, writing text between two stars as in `**boldface**` results in **boldface**, whereas one star `*italics*` results in *italics*. You can also use three stars for `*** bold italics ***` which appears as ***bold italics***.
